Introduction
============

A library for writing asynchronous JSON-RPC servers and clients in Python,
using Twisted. It aims to be as simple and easy to understand (and hack)
as possible.

============
Features
============

* Support for HTTP as protocol, more might come in the future.

* Full standards compliance (in progress :-) ).

* Support both JSON-RPC standards at once - great if you don't control your
  clients.

* 'Just work' with various clients (i.e. PHP, C++, JavaScript...)

============
TODO
============

* Batch requests

* Support keyword arguments

* Tests

* Better handling of errors in the client
